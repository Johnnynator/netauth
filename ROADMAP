NetAuth Roadmap

v0.0.1:
  * Authentication works
    * New entities can be added using a super-user account
    * Entities can be removed with a super-user account
    * Entities can be authenticated using a known secret
  * Minimum required entity metadata is available
    * An entity can be designated a global super-user; this is just a capability
    * Starting the server with special options will set this capability on this user
  * Minimum grouping support
    * A meta group "ALL" will return and contain all known entities of the server.

v0.0.2:
  * Authentication Enhancements
    * A super-user can change entities secrets
  * Full entity metadata support
    * All fields can be set on all entities using the RPC interface and CLI tools.
    * metadata can be modified via the CLI by either the owning entity or the super-user
  * Data Enhancements
    * Data is persisted to disk
    * Persistence layer is implemented as a pluggable, runtime selectable backend
    * A basic backend will be built by default, additional backends available via tags

v0.0.3:
  * Group support:
    * Users can be added to flat groups similar to the group file
    * Querying a user will return the groups for them
    * entitites can be added to and removed from multiple groups simultaneously via the CLI
      * multiple RPC calls will be made to the backend, but the CLI will abstract this
  * Cluster Support:
    * Multiple write capable masters with access to the data layer are available

v0.0.4:
  * Group Enhancements:
    * Groups can be nested
      * nest expansions can either be include or exclude
      * include is a direct expansion
      * exclude removes the contained entities from the containing group for this lookup
    * Groups can be managed by the CLI
      * groups can be moved around via the CLI
      * the CLI will show deltas of actions in terms of ACL entries changed
    * The entity graph will exist in memory as a directed acyclic graph with non-unique leaves
      * Membership updates will regenerate the entire graph
      * Leaf updates will act on leaves directly

v0.0.5:
  * Entity capabilities
    * capabilities can be used to denote additional access
    * capabilities grant the ability to modify a named group
      * "mini-administrators" that permit modifying everything under that tree
      * Change-Password capability

At this point a viable release candidate should exist.

v0.1.0:
  * API is marked stable
  * Development of other modules will be permitted to move forwards
