DB Implementations
==================

This directory includes the various database implementations that are
supported by NetAuth.  Each implementation may not be equal, for
example some may support multi master write access, while some may
only support local access.

Like the enity_manager itself, it is imperative that each
implementation have as much testing as possible.
