Somehow hooks need to be able to request chains be inserted into the
current execution run.  This likely needs to result in a change to the
hook datatype to allow them to return a chain name along with the
error, and then the executor will need to grab those chain members and
run them.

Putting this on the hook side means needing to feed hook
configuration back into the hooks, which creates a worse problem than
already exists with the tests.

At the same time as this change, references to the entity processor
should be dropped, things are now EntityHookChains and
GroupHookChains.  Names should be cleaned up as this change goes
through.
