The ListGroups function needs to move down into the database.
ListGroups should actually become SearchGroups, and should have a
SearchEntities companion.  These functions should be implemented in a
"polyfil" class so that memdb and protodb don't need to implement the
same shims.

Next*Number also needs to move into the polyfill.
