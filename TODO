The ListGroups function needs to move down into the database.
ListGroups should actually become SearchGroups, and should have a
SearchEntities companion.  These functions should be implemented in a
"polyfil" class so that memdb and protodb don't need to implement the
same shims.

Next*Number also needs to move into the polyfill.

Current flag configs should be transitioned to Viper.

Google Subcommands should be replaced with cobra commander.

Dynamic chain configuration needs to be figured out.

Plugins should actually be a thing:
  * go package plugins that load via SONAME loading will be the first wave.
  * support for go-plugin should come later.

There should be a boltdb backend.

The hacky db-migrator should be cleaned up and committed.

There should be a consul backend.
